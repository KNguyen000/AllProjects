Collection of my ML Projects

# Project 1
Use Audio from Amazon audiobook speakers and classify whether the speaker is either male or female.
Report for project is also included.
Project is viewing only as data is 8gb and will not fit in Github.

# Project 2
Use object detection model to detect objects in an image or video.
Use runMe.ipynb and change path of image or video to your image or video, then run program.
Program will take a long time to process.
